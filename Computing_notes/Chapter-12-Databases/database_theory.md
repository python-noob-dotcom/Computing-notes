# Database Theory

## What are Databases?

Databases store data, holds information.
    e.g. You are in charge of storing data in a library, you might set up a database that holds the information of books, patrons,
    people borrowing etc.

### Databases look similar to stuff like excel sheets, google spreadsheets, and ofc pandas DataFrames. But they are more powerful because

1. They can store more data
2. They can be secured using encryption
3. Multiple people can query to the database all at once

### There are different types of databases, such as relational databases etc.
