    "- `sqlite.connect('filepath')` lets you connect to database specified / create a database called the filepath\n",
    "- `connection.cursor()` lets you create a database cursor to use SQL statements and fetch results from SQL queries\n",
    "    - contains the useful stuff, fetchall(), fetch etc.\n",
    "    - resource management as well, execute SQL statements under the same amount of resources that is allocated for cursor\n",
    "- `cursor.execute('SQL statement')` lets you execute SQL statements. Refer to <i> Database 5 - Structured Query Language </i>\n",
    "    1. When executing statements such as `UPDATE XXXXXXXXXX SET XXXXXXXX = ....` need to make sure the statement is correct, because it will auto-commit changes\n",
    "- `execute_response.fetchall()` fetches all the data that you have selected in SQL statement / fetches status of the SQL statement executed if it is successful or not\n",
    "    1. The fetched response will leave the data response in a list of tuples, with each tuple being a singular row. Need to use indexing to go and filter through the data. If 1 index is left wrong, have to check and redo.\n",
    "- `connection.commit()` Must commit the changes to save the changes\n",
    "    - You must be committed to make the change\n",
    "- `connection.close()` make sure to close the connection to the database after using.\n",
    "- `connection.rollback()` Can only rollback changes before you commit\n",
    "    - stupid one cos rather just delete the code or edit the code above"
