    "## Introduction\n",
    "Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket (node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server.\n",

    "# Bind the socket to an address and port\n",
    "my_socket.bind(('127.0.0.1', 12345))  # this is a tuple consisting of the IP address string and the port number\n",
    "\n",
    "# Put the socket into listening mode\n",
    "my_socket.listen()  # after binding, start listening so that you can take in connections\n",
